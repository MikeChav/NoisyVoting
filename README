Final Project

In this folder are the following files:
- PROBLEM3v3_Chavrimootoo.pdf (the write-up of the project)
- Chavrimootoo.cpp (the implementations discussed in the write-up)
- README (this file)
- input0 (an example input)
- input1 (an example input)
- input2 (an example input)
- input3 (an example input)

The compile the code do:

g++ -std=c++11 Chavrimootoo.cpp

And run using:

./a.out < inputX

where X is in {0, 1, 2, 3} i.e. input is read form STDIN. You can use your own file (formatting explained below).

This project comes with 4 test files: input0, input1, input2, input3, where:
input0 : small example with random data
input1 : small example with a uniform distribution (dispersions = 1)
input2 : small example with low probability of winning for p
input3 : a larger example with random data

The test files are formatted as such:
c n p
v1 v2 ... vc       // n such lines
epsilon delta

The output is the probability estimate using the Monte Carlo method and the estimate using the Moser-Tardos method.

The code runs quite quickly: a few second for input2 and input3 and less for input0 and input1.
